Nota
====
Simple Zsh plugin to help my ADHD switch contexts a little bit faster and hopefully get some work done :)

Installation
============
```
# mkdir -p /usr/share/zsh/plugins/nota
# cp nota.zsh /usr/share/zsh/plugins/nota/
```

and make sure to `source` it somewhere in your shell startup scripts

```
source /usr/share/zsh/plugins/nota/nota.zsh
```

Usage
======
Just `notaadd`, `notaedit`, `notalist`, and `notadone` those are the most important functions to manage your `$NOTA_FILE` and `$NOTA_ARCIVE`
